<p><strong>rubz</strong>  is an argentineanðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· <strong>data analyst/scientist</strong> based in barcelona, spainðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. the goal of this website is to create content about programming, thoughts or any content in general.</p>
<h2 id="more-complete-bio">more complete bio:</h2>
<p>My name is Tomas, <em>the spaninsh version of Thomas</em>,  I was borned in 1997 in the beatiful city of <strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina</strong>. My childhood nickname is <strong>rubio</strong>, <em>which means blond in spanish</em>, and after a while I decided to change it to <strong>rubz</strong>.</p>
<p>I have more or less a normal childhood playing sports and video games. I went to an industrial high-school where I studied the basics of electronic engineering and also learned the basics of C++ programming micro controllers. Not a friendly programming language for a 15-year-old kid IMO, but that&rsquo;s for another disscussion.</p>
<p>After graduating highschool I didn&rsquo;t know what to do next. Most of my classmates decided to study some kind of engineering but I didn&rsquo;t like that idea since I was a terrible student during highschool and I didn&rsquo;t like studying that much. So with no so much time to decide, I enrolled in Bussines Management. I remembered that I wanted something that I could study along with working part-time so it was a no brainer for me.</p>
<p>At the half of my carreer, like almost anyone at that age, I had my first career crisis. I didn&rsquo;t like what I was studying, I was just studying to approve my finals and had a title under my belt. At that time I was also working full time as a kind of Customer Experience Analyst and I remember someone of my area who showed me <strong>Python</strong>, he was creating scripts to automate things at work. I found that so interesting that I decided to give it a try. I was always trying to find ways to automate my operational work and reduce my workload so if I was able to learn C++ in the past&hellip; why not?. This was my first attempt to learn how to program after highschool, I had never seen or heard about Python before and it changed my perspective about programming in general. I discovered a whole new world of possibilities with only a google search: Web developimg, Data Analysis, Web Scrapping, Data Science, Machine Learning&hellip; I was overwhelmed by the different things I could learn.</p>
<p>After learning the basics of the language and creating some scrappers to minimize my workload, in 2019 I quit my full-time job and signed up in a Data Science bootcamp. I told my parents I was really hyped about it and they agreed with helping me with the payment only if I keep studying my current degree as well. Now looking back at this moment, I realized <em><strong>this was one of my best decisions in my life</strong></em>, I remember being heavily judged for my decission. I was working at one of the best, <em>if not the best</em>, company in Argentina, <strong>Mercado Libre</strong>. Even though I was very comfortable there I was not learning anything and I was told I had to wait a year if I wanted to switch to a data related position. Many people there told me I was commiting a mistake, that if I stayed, I would be able to make a carreer and get promoted very fast. But I didn&rsquo;t wanted money or a fancy  title, I just wanted to enjoy working. My parents supporting my decission was also crucial I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done if they dissagree with me. So if you read this mum or dad, thank you ðŸ’˜.</p>
<p>Finally, I finished the bootcamp and graduated from college and starting working in data realted positions. I also keep learning stuff on my own and keep building projects in order to improve.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bpb9Lpy.jpg" alt="profile"></p>
<p>I consider my self as a curious person, I like to learn new things and to read books about everything. In 2021 I try readig philosophy and actually become an enthusiast about it. I identify myself with stoic way of thinking.</p>
