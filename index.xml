      <description>Continuing with the series of posts that I am putting together about the selection processes in the world of data, I leave here this second part focused on the evaluations of statistics, programming and machine learning. Everything you are going to read is subject to a compilation of personal experiences, talks with colleagues and the Internet. There is no exact formula but I hope I can provide you with a skeleton of how the different parts are evaluated.</description>

      <description>When I was a teenager I was very bad at studying, in high school there was not a year where I did not go to summer school and in general the habit of studying annoyed me. But years later, when I entered college, I realized that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that I hated studying, I hated what I believed back then to be studying. I used to think that studying was sitting down and reading the book or the summaries that I have written on the subject thousands of times.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how companies or apps do to recommend moderately successful content? When I asked myself this question I thought that obviously they must have a lot of information about their products such as Mercado Libre or Amazon: Product categories, weight, purchase and search history, which product is usually bought together with and so we can continue thinking of variables that could help recommend a product to a potential buyer.</description>

      <description>Following advice from leaders in the world of DS (Data Science) in Argentina, I decided to look for an old notebook that I had made to practice and write a short article that may help someone understand what is done in data science or introduce someone who has not the slightest idea in basic concepts.
Summary What we are going to be doing throughout the post is through a dataset (Dataset) provided by one of the kaggle competitions, we are going to first carry out a brief analysis of the information we have and then carry out a predictive model that identifies , according to certain variables, if the person survived or not.</description>
