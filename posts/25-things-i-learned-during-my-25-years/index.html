			<p>Today I am turning 25. I can&rsquo;t believe how fast time slips, without knowing you are completing a quarter of a century in this uncertain and strange quest of life. A few months ago I had this idea of writing lessons I had during this last 25 years. Not only to share them with people but also as a kind of time capsule for the future me. It&rsquo;s going to be fun  to read this in 10 or 20 years later and compare if something on this list had change. I could write more than 25 (And I think 25 it&rsquo;s too much) but to keep it short and concise I decided to set 25 as the total number.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I consider this list of lessons as a gift to the people that shared with me this 25 years, or at least a part of them. Some of you helped me to think, understand and also embrace many of the things I am going to talk about. I always felt extremely luckly to have the family I have, to meet the friends I met, to love the people I loved, to work with the people I worked. Everyone contributed to develop the person that I am today. I am going to quote Jorge Luis Borges &ldquo;I am not sure that I exist, actually, I am all the authors I had read, all the people I had met, all the women I had loved, all the cities I had visited&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enjoy&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Life is a constant problem solving</li>
</ol>
<p>As it says, if life would be different, it would be too boring. We should be able to face problems daily, getting anxious about it is worst. There is no one on the earth that do not have any problem, everyone is going through something in their heads. The difference is that there is people that get anxious about it and people that don&rsquo;t. The idea of life is getting more and more complex problems, understanding this is a <em><strong>must</strong></em> to avoid anxiety.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>We suffer more in imagination than in reality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seneca wrote this, but sometimes you need to repeat this quote in your head weekly or sometimes daily. I have this bad habit of thinking and imagining situations way before they happen. I can tell that always, the amount of grief or pain I went through is a hundred times worst that the real situation.
If we can&rsquo;t avoid overthinking situations, we need to repeat ourselves that reality is way different</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering</li>
</ol>
<p>Is not a good thing to hold your emotions, our emotions are real feedback about a situation that we are facing. So if you feel sad or angry when you receive some news, <strong>don&rsquo;t try to avoid them</strong>. Instead, understand why are you feeling the way you are. Accept your emotions and <em><strong>learn how to control your actions</strong></em>, this is the only thing that is in your control.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The world is a tragedy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have something to say, silence is a lie</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I read this one in the book &ldquo;12 Rules for Life&rdquo; by Jordan Peterson, And I can relate so much to this quote. I can count many times that I kept silence to avoid conflict or thinking it was a waste of time. In this situations, silence is a lie to yourself.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>You&rsquo;re gonna carry that weight</li>
</ol>
<p>I read this on the anime called &ldquo;Cowboy Bebop&rdquo; (Must watch). What I reflected about this quote and the show, is that we can&rsquo;t escape our past. In order to have a future, we need to accept our past. In others words, carry that weight. We are going to carry our errors, mistakes, suffering you name it. Learn to live carrying that weight</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>I am not guilty of what happens to me, I am only responsible of how I react to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This one is related to the dichotomy of control proposed by the <strong>stoics</strong>. Bsaically the stoics divide the things you can control against the ones you can&rsquo;t control and why you shouldn&rsquo;t worry or suffer from things you can&rsquo;t control. Is a very basic thing, we shouldn&rsquo;t suffer from things that we cannot control like the outcome of an event, our health, our past, this is way out of your control. The only thing you can control is how you react to this things and this has nothing to do with staying positive all the time, is when something bad happens to you, understand that you cannot change anything and there is no way you could&rsquo;ve avoid this. I believe this is a path to live with less suffering, how many times are we blaming ourselves for things that we cannot control?</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Some of the greatest moments of one&rsquo;s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known and not positive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone can look at their own life and look for this kind of moment. The moment where now you remember with a smiley face, but not because they were joyful or happy moments. Because now you know how they help you to get stronger, to grow as a person, to face problems. At that time you couldn&rsquo;t understand it, Why is this happening to me? Did I do something wrong? You blame yourself, you blame life and maybe you blame others. But we can all agree that in this moments of grief, we usually learn more. Let&rsquo;s be honest, you can only grow or get stronger if you experience the pain. There is no easy way of learning how to go through rejection, loss or pain. The only way is facing them.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>A person starts to live when he stops escaping from death and accept it</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding death is one of the most important things when you are growing up. You will save a lot of suffering, blame and anxiety.
e. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you do not have to be sad about it, just understand that is not in your control. Death could happen to anyone close to you. Unfortunately death is the only certain future we all have in common. We can not choose when  or  how it is going to happen. When you fully understand that death is something we can&rsquo;t control you will be able to handle loss much easier.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Hate will never win</li>
</ol>
<p>I have this one tattooed on my arm. Is the name of a song by XXXTentacion, one of my favorites artists. And also this is something I truly believe and reflected over the last few years.<br>
Hate will never heal a scar or fill the pain of something you went through. Hate will only bring more hate to the world. There are tons of examples in real life, take for example war, the only thing it brought is more hate. We can call this &ldquo;The cycle of hatred&rdquo;. Using violence or hate as a way of justice, will only bring more vengeance and create a cycle with no end.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>Justice doesn;t exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear is the mind-killer</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have this tweet of Elon Musk as a cover picture on twitter. This tweet is from the beginning of the pandemic two years ago. You can apply this to covid or to whatever other fear you have. You can relate this lesson with the one accepting the death. You can&rsquo;t escape from death so don&rsquo;t let fear consume your mind. Don&rsquo;t stop living because of fear, don&rsquo;t let the fear control your life and don&rsquo;t let others impose fear on you. Fear is a very powerful tool this days, with fear you can control people and divide them. Fear is like suffering in our heads, imagining hypothetical situations. You can&rsquo;t live  with fear in your mind, it will consume you.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Build more than you consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the technology keeps growing at a very fast speed, we are getting more and more comfortable. You can get a lot of entertainment at the palm of your hand with your phone. Social media, games, Netflix and Spotify. We become slaves of our phones because we seek entertainment on them. I am not saying that using them is bad, but everything is balance.. Instead of watching one hour of Youtube about the drama of some famous person, use it to learn something new or to train something you want to train. Or you can read a book about a topic you are interested but never try it. In the end, I am not saying that consuming is wrong. We need entertainment in our life. But everything is balance, don&rsquo;t use 90% of your time on consuming.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Take care of your mind</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides taking care of your body, which is also very important, taking care of our minds is a must. When you think about a healthy life-style, most of the times, you will imagine someone who works out regularly and eats healthy food. We rarely imagine someone who journal their thoughts and reflects on their past. In other words, we don&rsquo;t think about training our mind. You never know what could happen in your life. You can loose an arm or a leg and stop walking. But if you loose your mind, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Be a constant junior, don&rsquo;t stop learning</li>
</ol>
<p>You should always be learning and considering yourself junior in some part of your life. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be always related to education or work. You can learn things for pleasure. But the process of learning combined with curiosity is a habit I consider a must.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>High risk, high reward</li>
</ol>
<p>Apply this in everything in your life, work, education, finance you name it. If you are not willing to risk things you are not getting a proportional reward. Everyone wants high reward taking low risks.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>You can&rsquo;t always fix everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not so long ago, I used to think I could fix anything, relationships, my problems, other person problems. It took me a lot of time to understand that sometimes you can&rsquo;t fix everything. Not because it is not possible, because there are a lot of things that are out of your control and you need to live with that. Besides control, you need to understand that sometimes is not healthy to be the person that fixes everything. Neither for you or for the other person. Sometimes you just need to listen and be present but not get involved in fixing the problem.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>You can&rsquo;t get along with everyone</li>
</ol>
<p>There are people who is gonna like you and people who don&rsquo;t. I am being repetitive but you can control the perception you have about yourself but not the perception others have about you. And also in the end, what matters the most? Your opinion about yourself or the opinion of random people you met?</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Stop waiting for perfection to start doing something</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply as it it, stop waiting for something to happen in order to do an activity or a hobby. An example will describe this better. In my case, a few weeks ago I wanted to start running again but I keep making excuses that I wanted to find a good place to run. Do I need a good place to be able to run? No, so that&rsquo;s a more suitable way of making excuses. Not finding the perfect time or environment to do some activity.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>There is some kind of beauty in imperfection.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a japanese word, wabi sabi 侘寂. In japanese culture they use this word to refer to the  beauty in  imperfect, impermanent and incomplete things.  Accepting imperfections is not only in yourself  you have to think this within your family, relationships or friendships. No one is going to be the way you want them to be and that is kind of beautiful. We grow up bombarded with advertisements and a culture of pursuing perfection instead of appreciating existence as it is: perfectly imperfect. Embracing this kind of thinking will help us to live a more calm life without getting anxious for not reaching the &ldquo;standards&rdquo;.</p>
