      <description>Have you ever wondered how companies or Apps do to recommend moderately successful content to what we are consuming? When I asked myself this question I thought that obviously they must have a lot of information about their products such as Mercado Libre or Amazon: Product categories, weight, our purchase and search history, which product is usually bought together with another and so we can continue thinking of variables that could help recommend a product to a potential buyer.</description>
