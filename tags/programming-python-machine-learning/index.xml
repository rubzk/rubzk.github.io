      <description>Following advice from leaders in the world of DS (Data Science) in Argentina, I decided to look for an old notebook that I had made to practice and write a short article that may help someone understand what is done in data science or able to introduce someone who has not the slightest idea in basic concepts.
Summary What we are going to be doing throughout the post is through a dataset (Dataset) provided by one of the kaggle competitions, we are going to first carry out a brief analysis of the information we have and then carry out a predictive model that identifies according to certain variables that the data set has if the person survived or not.</description>
