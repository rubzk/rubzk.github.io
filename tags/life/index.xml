      <description>Today I am turning 25. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how fast time slips, without knowing you are completing a quarter of a century in this uncertain and strange quest of life. A few months ago I had this idea of writing lessons I had during this last 25 years. Not only to share them with people but also as a kind of time capsule for the future me. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be fun to read this in 10 or 20 years later and compare if something on this list had change.</description>
